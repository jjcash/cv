    <h1>My Hobbies:</h1>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> I'm a PC gamer ever since I was 6 years old! My favorite games are World of Warcraft, Mafia and Mass Effect. ðŸŽ®</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Music:</strong> Trying to learn how to play guitar... I'm really eclectic when it comes to music, I listen to almost any genre, from classic to hard rock! ðŸŽµ</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Literature:</strong> Usually I tend to read a lot of mid to late 19th century and early 20th century books. Absolute love Edgar Allan Poe and horror short-stories! ðŸ“–</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Astronomy:</strong> For me there's nothing more peaceful than looking at the night sky filled with stars, and imagine all the possibilities that lie in the future of humankind. ðŸŒŸ</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Discovering and Learning:</strong> I love the feeling of fulfillment that I get whenever I learn something new, no matter the subject, philosophy, chemistry, computer science, you name it! ðŸ§ </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Foreign Languages:</strong> Although I'm only fluent in Portuguese and English, there's something really special for me to learn new words from other languages. In the near future I intend to continue my studies in German and French, and later on perhaps Japanese and Italian (my family descends from Italian and German immigrants, so a lot of my interest in these two particular languages comes from that). ðŸ“š</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Movies and TV Shows:</strong> and last but not least, sometimes is good to jump in bed and watch a horror movie or maybe a TV Show, and when it comes to TV Shows I have no preferences, I enjoy watching almost any genre of TV Shows. ðŸ“º</li>
                </ul>
